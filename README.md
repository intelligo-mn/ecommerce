## Development

### 1. Install top-level dependencies

`yarn`

The root directory has a `package.json` which contains build-related dependencies for tasks including:

* Building & deploying the docs 
* Generating TypeScript types from the GraphQL schema
* Linting, formatting & testing tasks to run on git commit & push

### 2. Bootstrap the packages

`yarn bootstrap`

This runs the Lerna "bootstrap" command, which cross-links monorepo dependencies.

### 3. Build all packages

`yarn build`

Packages must be built (i.e. TypeScript compiled, admin ui app built, certain assets copied etc.) before being used.

Note that this can take a few minutes.

### 4. Set up the server

The server requires an SQL database to be available. The simplest option is to use SQLite, but if you have Docker available you can use the [dev-server docker-compose file](./packages/dev-server/docker-compose.yml) which will start up both MariaDB and Postgres as well as their GUI management tools.

Vendure uses [TypeORM](http://typeorm.io), and officially supports **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL** and **SQLite**, though other TypeORM-supported databases may work.

1. Configure the [dev config](./packages/dev-server/dev-config.ts), making sure the connection settings in the `getDbConfig()` function are correct for the database type you will be using.
2. Create the database using your DB admin tool of choice (e.g. phpMyAdmin if you are using the docker image suggested above). Name it according to the `getDbConfig()` settings. If you are using SQLite, you can skip this step.
3. Populate mock data: 
   ```bash
    cd packages/dev-server
    yarn populate
    ```
   If you do not specify the `DB` variable, it will default to "mysql".

### 5. Run the dev server

```
cd packages/dev-server
yarn start
```
Or if you are in the root package 
```
yarn dev-server:start
```
