# Introduction

I'm starting a new series in which we will create a dev.to clone in angular. I will release some work every Thursday. I'm busy on all other days. I will use

1. Component store for state management
1. rx-angular/template for RxLet and push pipe

Rest we will add stuff as needed and think about it in various scenario's as we go. I'll add stuff to github repo on Thursday and drop an article on what we did on Friday. Follow along if you want to learn more about Angular.
